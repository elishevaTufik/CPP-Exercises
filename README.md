# C++ Exercises

This repository contains a collection of **C++ programming exercises**, created as part of practice and homework assignments.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate core programming concepts in C++ through small, focused examples.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each file or folder in the repository represents a standalone exercise covering a specific topic in C++.  
The exercises progress from beginner concepts to more advanced topics.

- A C++ compiler such as:
  - **g++** (GNU Compiler Collection)
  - **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++)
  - **Clang**
- C++11 or later standard is recommended.
